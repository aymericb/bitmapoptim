Foreword
--------
The thirdparties need to be compiled, as they are used internally by BitmapOptim.

======================================================================================================================

Requirements
------------

- Visual Studio 2010 Professional SP1 (other compilers will probably work with small changes)
- CMake 2.8.7 or greater
- Powershell

======================================================================================================================

Instructions to build the third parties
---------------------------------------

1- Set the location of 7zip and CMake executables into BuildConfig.xml

2- Launch the download_sources.ps1 with powershell (you might need to adjust the execution policy. See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx)

This script will parse the BuildConfig.xml file, download the third parties, extract the sources, and copy the 
CMakeFile.text files into the target folder.

3- Run CMake either by hand, or use the cmake.ps1 script. The script automatically set the compiler preferences
to match visual studio 2010
