Foreword
--------
The thirdparties need to be compiled, as they are used internally by BitmapOptim.

======================================================================================================================

Requirements
------------

- Visual Studio 2010 Professional SP1 (other compilers will probably work with small changes)
- CMake 2.8.7 or greater
- Powershell

======================================================================================================================

Instructions to build the third parties
---------------------------------------

1- Set powershell to execute the scripts contained in this directory.
   The easy way is to allow *any* script to run.
   * run powershell console with admin privileges
   * type 'Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted'
   * reply 'Y' for yes

2- Set the location of 7zip and CMake executables into BuildConfig.xml

3- Launch the download.ps1 with powershell
   This script downloads and patch the thirdparties files.

4- Build the thirdparties with build.ps1
   This script executes CMake multiple times to build the third parties.
